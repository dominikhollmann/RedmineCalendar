- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- FR-002 references "weeklyHours / 5" as the duration formula — this is a business rule, not an implementation detail; it is expressed in user-visible terms in FR-002 and SC-001.
- Public holiday skipping is explicitly out of scope (Assumptions section).
- Partial-failure handling (FR-008) is covered by a dedicated edge case and success criterion.
